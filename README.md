# AutoHotkey Scripts

## GG_Volume

This script offers a very basic GUI that provides profile-like volume configurations for SteelSeries GG. You can add more profiles or adjust the volumes in the existing profiles where 0.0 means 0% volume, and 1.0 is 100% volume. Pixel values were determined on 2560 Ã— 1440 display with 100% scaling in the Windows Display settings. You may find that you need to adjust this if on a different scale or native resolution.
